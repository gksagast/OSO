An affordable EMG/FMG hybrid sensor with feedback capabilities

Updates, availability, and related files to the project can be found in this repository.

The goal of this work is to develop a low-cost, modular sensor unit that contains two sensing modalities and one feedback mechanism. EMG will be employed to measure the electrical activity of muscles just below the surface of the skin, and FMG will measure skin deflection in response to muscle contraction. A haptic motor will provide feedback to the user based on input from the controller. A desktop PC logs EMG and FMG data and sets conditions for haptic feedback. With this framework in mind, we will use the following criteria to determine exact device specifications.
